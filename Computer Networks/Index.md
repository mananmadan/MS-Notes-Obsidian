### <u>What is a network</u>
- A communication system of machines basically
### <u>History</u>
- First intra communication network set up was ARPA-NET
- It was set up by different universities in the US to communicate with each other, basically for communication within the ARPA organization
### <u>Protocols?</u>
 - There can be different type of data that can be sent via the connection/ network
 - And since the party that is sending the data and that is receiving the data, should have the same set of rules, a bunch of rules have been decided by the **Internet Society**
 - There are multiple protocols which are suitable for different types of data such as TCP, UDP, HTTP
## <u>IP Addresses?</u>
- An IP Address is your location on the net
- When you type google.com what happens?
	- An IP Address of the server is resolved for google's server
	- A request is sent to that server to get the html page
	- That server sends the request to our computer and then the page is rendered
- **Modems**
	- A global IP Address is provided by your ISP (Airtel, Jio etc) which is mapped onto the modem
	- So all the devices connected on that modem/local wifi will have the same IP Address
	- But then modem also distributes some local ip addresses to each machine that is connected to differentiate them using the DHCP protocol
	- So if you sent a request to google from any of the machines, google will see the IP Address that is assigned to the modem
	- when the request comes back, then the router also has to decide which device the data has to go, it does that using NAT, network access translator
- ***Good Point: There are multiple application that could have requested this data within the device, how do you decide which application requested the data, because the each of these applications will have the IP Addrs of the machine or rather local IP Addr given by the modem, so the ans to this is: <u>Port Number</u>***

  ### <u>SUBMARINE Cables</u>
  - There are optical fibres connecting each of the countries together
