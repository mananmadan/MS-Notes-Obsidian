 - A practice project could be to implement a file server
	 - One client asks for a file in the path
	 - The server has to look up the contents of the file in the path, parse them and and send this buffer to the client
	 - The client would receive this buffer and put it into a file
	 - Can do it in a single thread, and write a script, the basically randomly spawns upon clients and requests them
	 - Could next do it in multi threaded situation and then compare throughput
	 - Single threaded and multi threaded could be based on a flag
